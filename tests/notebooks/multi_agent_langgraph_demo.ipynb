    "# Multi-Agent Demo: LangGraph + Recursive Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining Workflow Orchestration with Agent Introspection\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how Recursive Agents agents integrate with LangGraph workflows. Since RA agents are callables, they work seamlessly as LangGraph nodes while preserving their thinking transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Demo Shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration**: How RA agents become LangGraph nodes\n",
    "2. **Workflow Execution**: Running agents through LangGraph's orchestration\n",
    "3. **Debug Visibility**: What LangGraph's debug stream provides\n",
    "4. **Thinking History**: How RA's introspection remains accessible\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight: you get both workflow management and agent reasoning visibility without choosing between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed analysis, see [`docs/LangGraph_RA_comp.md`](../docs/LangGraph_RA_comp.md)"

This decline is primarily due to serious concerns regarding functionality and usability. Common issues reported by users include crashes during critical tasks and slow loading times, leading to poor user experiences. For example, one user mentioned, \"The app crashes every time I try to upload a photo,\" emphasizing the direct impact of functionality issues on user satisfaction.\\n\\n2. **Crashes on iOS 17.2:**\\n   - Increased crash reports are specifically linked to the rollout of iOS 17.2, indicating compatibility issues. Users frequently experience crashes when launching the app, which directly contributes to negative feedback and a decline in ratings. For instance, when users attempt to access popular features and encounter crashes, they are more likely to express their frustration through negative reviews, creating a cycle of dissatisfaction.\\n\\n3. **User Feedback:**\\n   - An analysis of app store reviews reveals recurring themes in user dissatisfaction, including frequent mentions of bugs, reduced performance speed, and incomplete functionalities. Including direct quotes from user reviews, such as \"The new update made the app so slow that I can\\'t use it,\" highlights the urgency of addressing these issues to prevent further declines in user satisfaction.\\n\\n4. **Engagement Metrics:**\\n   - There has been a noticeable 20% decrease in daily active users (DAU) and monthly active users (MAU) since the update. For context, prior to the update, DAU was approximately 50,000, and MAU was around 150,000. This significant decline indicates that users are not only dissatisfied but are disengaging from the app, which is further reflected in retention rates.\\n\\n5. **Uninstalls:**\\n   - The uninstall rate has surged by 30% since the iOS 17.2 update compared to the previous month, illustrating a serious reaction from users dissatisfied with their experience. Previously, the uninstall rate was approximately 5%, which makes the current increase notable.

       "\n",
       "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "**Critique of Draft Response:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Clarity on User Complaints:**\n",
       "   - The section on user complaints lacks specificity regarding the volume and nature of the feedback. While it mentions slow upload speeds and crashes, it would be beneficial to quantify these issues (e.g., \"80% of users reported slow uploads\"). \n",
       "   - **Suggestion:** Include statistics or percentages for greater impact. For instance, state how many users have reported crashes or what percentage specifically mention upload issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Segmentation of User Feedback:**\n",
       "   - The draft describes general patterns but fails to differentiate between types of users (new vs. returning users, for example). This distinction could lead to more targeted solutions.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion:** Incorporate a breakdown of feedback by user type, highlighting if newer users are more likely to leave negative reviews compared to long-term users.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Lack of Specificity in Competitive Analysis:**\n",
       "   - The mention of competitors is vague (“[Competitor A] and [Competitor B]”). Notably, it does not explain what issues these competitors faced and how they resolved them.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion:** Provide specific examples of competitor strategies that were effective in similar situations. This could include features that enhanced user experience or specific improvements they made.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Engagement Metrics and Their Implications:**\n",
       "   - The draft mentions declining DAU and MAU but does not elaborate on the potential causes or further implications of these declines, such as potential revenue loss or long-term user retention issues.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion:** Expand on how these declining metrics affect business objectives, such as profitability, customer loyalty, or market share.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Points Needing More Data - Broader Context:**\n",
       "   - The section on necessary data lacks context on how this data will relate to decision-making or improvement measures. For instance, it mentions user demographics but does not indicate how this information will influence the proposed solutions.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion:** Clearly articulate how each data point will be utilized in the decision-making process.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Next Steps - Prioritization:**\n",
       "   - The next steps do not prioritize actions based on urgency or impact. For example, while technical investigation is essential, immediate user feedback might be equally critical for shaping rapid improvements.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion:** Rank the next steps in order of priority and urgency. Perhaps use a matrix to categorize them based on impact and effort.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Timeline for Next Steps:**\n",
       "   - The proposed timeline for next steps presents durations, but it would be helpful to clarify dependencies. For instance, is the technical investigation required before performance enhancement can begin?\n",
       "   - **Suggestion:** Clearly indicate which steps are dependent on others and provide a visual timeline if possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Communication Strategy:**\n",
       "   - The communication strategy mentions informing users but lacks specifics about the tone, frequency, and channels of communication. Users may appreciate regular updates, especially if they are experiencing issues.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion:** Elaborate on how often updates will be communicated and ensure to include channels that users actively engage with, such as forums or in-app messages.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Missing Information on Long-term Strategy:**\n",
       "   - While immediate actions are covered, there’s no mention of a long-term strategy for user retention and ongoing improvement. Addressing immediate concerns is important, but ensuring long-term user satisfaction is crucial.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion:** Include a section outlining long-term strategies to monitor and enhance user feedback, engagement, and app performance continuously.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Overall Assessment:**\n",
       "The draft response provides a solid initial analysis of the issue, outlining several key areas of concern and subsequent action steps. However, it requires further detail, specificity, and prioritization to enhance clarity and effectiveness. The response should showcase a deeper understanding of user dynamics and strategic planning to foster user trust and improve app performance sustainably.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Suggestions for Revision:**\n",
       "1. Integrate quantitative data regarding user complaints and engagement metrics.\n",
       "2. Differentiate feedback by user demographics for targeted solutions.\n",
       "3. Provide concrete examples from competitors to strengthen the analysis.\n",
       "4. Clarify the implications of declining engagement metrics on business objectives.\n",
       "5. Elaborate on how additional data will inform decision-making processes.\n",
       "6. Prioritize next steps based on urgency and impact.\n",
       "7. Clarify the timeline with dependencies and a visual aid if possible.\n",
       "8. Define the communication strategy more clearly, ensuring regular user engagement.\n",

       "### Critique 1\n",
       "\n",
       "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Clarity and Completeness of Symptom Description  \n",
       "- The draft clearly states the two main symptoms: rating drop and upload crashes on iOS 17.2. However, it would benefit from explicitly stating the timeframe over which these issues emerged or worsened to better establish correlation.  \n",
       "- The note “No explicit mention of crashes on other iOS versions or platforms” is important but could be more assertively framed as a key unknown rather than a passive observation. This would emphasize the need to verify platform scope early.  \n",
       "- Suggestion: Add a brief statement about when the rating drop and crashes started relative to iOS 17.2 release, if known, or explicitly note that this information is currently missing.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Apparent Correlations and Relationships  \n",
       "- The draft correctly links the rating drop to the upload crash on iOS 17.2, but it stops short of considering alternative or compounding factors that might also affect ratings (e.g., unrelated app bugs, UI changes, or external factors).  \n",
       "- Suggestion: Include a note that while the timing suggests a connection, other factors influencing ratings should be ruled out to avoid premature attribution.  \n",
       "- The draft mentions hardware variability but does not explicitly suggest checking for differences in iOS 17.2 subversions or beta vs. stable releases, which could be relevant.  \n",
       "- Suggestion: Recommend verifying if the issue is consistent across all iOS 17.2 builds and device models.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Missing Diagnostic Data and Information Gaps  \n",
       "- This section is thorough but could be improved by grouping related items for easier digestion. For example, group crash-related data (logs, reproduction steps) separately from user feedback and backend data.  \n",
       "- The draft omits mention of analytics data such as session logs, upload success/failure rates, or telemetry that might provide insight into the crash frequency or conditions.  \n",
       "- Suggestion: Add a bullet about reviewing app analytics and telemetry data to detect patterns or anomalies correlated with iOS 17.2.  \n",
       "- User feedback is noted as missing beyond rating decline, but no mention is made of social media or app store review mining, which could provide qualitative insights.  \n",
       "- Suggestion: Recommend mining app store reviews and social media for user reports related to upload crashes or other issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Next Steps for Investigation  \n",
       "- The steps are generally well-structured but could be prioritized or sequenced to reflect logical investigative flow (e.g., start with data collection, then reproduction, then code/dependency review).  \n",
       "- Suggestion: Reorder steps to begin with gathering crash reports and user feedback, then reproduction attempts, followed by code and backend analysis.  \n",
       "- The draft suggests analyzing third-party dependencies but does not specify which types (e.g., networking libraries, file handling modules) or mention checking for iOS 17.2 API deprecations or behavioral changes.  \n",
       "- Suggestion: Add a specific callout to review iOS 17.2 release notes for API changes that might impact upload functionality.  \n",
       "- The communication and mitigation section is appropriate but could be expanded to include internal stakeholder alignment (e.g., development, QA, support) and a timeline for updates to users.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Style and Tone  \n",
       "- The draft maintains a professional and neutral tone, avoiding premature conclusions, which is appropriate.  \n",
       "- Some sentences are passive or indirect (e.g., “No explicit mention…”) and could be more direct to emphasize action points.  \n",
       "- Suggestion: Use active voice and clear calls to action to improve readability and urgency (e.g., “Confirm whether crashes occur on other iOS versions…”).\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Structural and Formatting Suggestions  \n",
       "- Consider numbering or bulleting all main points consistently for easier reference.  \n",
       "- Adding subheadings within sections (e.g., “Crash Data,” “User Feedback,” “Backend Analysis”) could improve clarity.  \n",
       "- A summary or “Key Unknowns” section might help highlight critical information gaps upfront.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall Assessment  \n",
       "The draft provides a solid initial breakdown of the problem, clearly identifying symptoms, correlations, missing data, and next steps without jumping to conclusions. It demonstrates careful consideration of the available information and appropriate caution in diagnosis. However, it would benefit from clearer prioritization of investigative steps, more explicit identification of unknowns, and inclusion of additional data sources such as analytics and social media feedback. Improving clarity through active language and better grouping of related points will enhance usability for stakeholders. Incorporating these suggestions will produce a more actionable and comprehensive response aligned with the original request.\n",

       "\n",
       "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Clarity and Readability  \n",
       "- The draft is generally clear and well-structured, but some sections are dense with information, which may overwhelm readers unfamiliar with technical diagnostics.  \n",
       "- Suggestion: Use more concise bullet points or sub-bullets to break down complex ideas, especially in sections 3 (Missing Diagnostic Data) and 4 (Prioritized Next Steps). For example, separate crash data, user feedback, and backend analysis more distinctly with clear headers or indentation.  \n",
       "- Some sentences are lengthy and could be simplified for easier comprehension. For example, “The onset or worsening of both the rating decline and upload crashes appears to coincide with the release or increased adoption of iOS 17.2; however, precise timing data is currently unavailable and should be confirmed.” could be split into two sentences for clarity.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Completeness and Coverage  \n",
       "- The draft thoroughly covers many relevant aspects but misses some important angles:  \n",
       "  a. No mention of whether the app has any crash reporting or monitoring tools already integrated (e.g., Crashlytics, Sentry). This is critical for gathering crash data and should be explicitly noted as a verification step.  \n",
       "  b. The impact on different user segments (e.g., new vs. returning users, geographic regions) is not addressed but could provide valuable insight into the rating drop.  \n",
       "  c. No explicit mention of testing on non-iOS platforms or older iOS versions beyond the brief note in section 2 and 4. This could be emphasized more strongly to rule out platform-specific regressions.  \n",
       "  d. The draft does not consider potential memory or resource constraints on certain devices that might cause crashes, which could be a relevant diagnostic angle.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Suggestion: Add explicit checks for existing crash monitoring tools and their data availability. Include analysis of user segments and geographic distribution in user feedback and analytics. Emphasize cross-platform and cross-version testing as a priority.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Accuracy and Technical Detail  \n",
       "- The draft correctly identifies the need to review iOS 17.2 release notes for API changes but could be more specific about what kinds of changes to look for (e.g., deprecated APIs, new privacy restrictions, network stack changes).  \n",
       "- Suggestion: Include examples of typical iOS update impacts that commonly cause upload or crash issues, such as changes in file system access, background task handling, or network permissions. This helps focus investigation.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Structure and Flow  \n",
       "- The draft’s structure is logical but could benefit from clearer separation between diagnostic data gathering and hypothesis testing. Currently, some points mix data collection with assumptions about causality (e.g., section 2).  \n",
       "- Suggestion: Reorganize so that section 2 strictly lists observations and correlations without implying causation, then move all hypothesis-driven considerations to section 4 or a new section explicitly for hypothesis formulation and testing.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Style and Tone  \n",
       "- The tone is professional and appropriately cautious, emphasizing verification and avoiding premature conclusions.  \n",
       "- Minor wording improvements could enhance engagement, such as replacing “unknown” or “missing” with “currently unavailable” or “to be confirmed” for a more proactive tone.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Missing Information and Next Steps  \n",
       "- The draft does not explicitly mention the importance of reproducing the crash in a controlled environment using device simulators or physical devices with iOS 17.2. While implied, this should be stated explicitly as a critical next step.  \n",
       "- Suggestion: Add a dedicated point about setting up reproducible test environments, including simulators and real devices, to isolate the problem.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Also missing is a risk assessment or impact analysis section that estimates how widespread or severe the issue is, which could help prioritize fixes and communication.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Communication and Coordination  \n",
       "- The communication plan is sound but could be expanded to include internal knowledge sharing and documentation updates to prevent recurrence.  \n",
       "- Suggestion: Recommend establishing a central issue tracking document accessible to all stakeholders and scheduling regular cross-team syncs during the investigation and remediation phases.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall Assessment and Suggestions for Revision  \n",
       "The draft provides a comprehensive and methodical overview of the problem and investigation steps, demonstrating solid technical understanding and a cautious approach. However, it can be improved by clarifying and simplifying language, explicitly including checks for existing crash monitoring tools, emphasizing cross-platform testing, and separating observation from hypothesis more clearly. Adding explicit steps for reproducible testing and risk assessment will strengthen the diagnostic plan. Enhancing the communication section with internal coordination details will improve stakeholder alignment.\n",
       "\n",
       "A revised version should:  \n",
       "- Break down dense sections with clearer formatting and concise language  \n",
       "- Explicitly verify crash monitoring tools and data availability  \n",
       "- Emphasize cross-version and cross-platform testing early  \n",
       "- Separate observed correlations from investigative hypotheses  \n",
       "- Add explicit reproducible testing steps using simulators and devices  \n",
       "- Include impact assessment to prioritize efforts  \n",
       "- Expand communication to include internal documentation and regular updates\n",
       "\n",
       "These changes will increase clarity, completeness, and actionable guidance, making the response more practical and easier to follow for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\n",

       "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Clarity and Structure\n",
       "\n",
       "- The draft is comprehensive but dense, which may overwhelm readers seeking quick insights.  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Consider adding a concise executive summary at the beginning that highlights the core issues (rating drop, upload crashes on iOS 17.2), key unknowns, and immediate next steps. This will orient stakeholders before diving into details.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Some sections (e.g., “Diagnostic Data Needs” and “Hypotheses and Prioritized Next Steps”) overlap in content, causing redundancy.  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Merge related diagnostic and testing steps into a single, clearly ordered action plan. For example, combine “Crash Data,” “User Feedback and Analytics,” and “Backend Analysis” under a unified “Data Collection and Analysis” heading, followed by “Testing and Verification” as a separate section.\n",
       "\n",
       "- The numbering scheme is inconsistent in style and detail (e.g., some points use bullets, others use letters).  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Use a consistent hierarchical numbering or lettering system throughout to improve readability and navigation.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Completeness and Detail\n",
       "\n",
       "- The draft notes the absence of crash logs and reproduction steps but does not explicitly recommend prioritizing their immediate collection.  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Emphasize the urgency of obtaining detailed crash logs and reproduction steps as foundational to diagnosis.\n",
       "\n",
       "- The impact assessment section is somewhat generic and lacks concrete metrics or examples.  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Propose specific KPIs to measure impact, such as percentage of active users on iOS 17.2, upload failure rate, and rating trend over time, to quantify severity and prioritize fixes.\n",
       "\n",
       "- The communication plan focuses on informing users about the issue but omits guidance on managing user expectations or mitigating negative sentiment beyond workarounds.  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Include recommendations for proactive customer support messaging, FAQs, and possibly temporary app store messaging to maintain trust.\n",
       "\n",
       "- The draft does not address potential security or privacy implications that might arise from iOS 17.2 changes affecting uploads.  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Add a note to review security/privacy-related iOS 17.2 updates that could impact upload functionality or user permissions.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Accuracy and Consistency\n",
       "\n",
       "- The draft states “Upload functionality crashes consistently on devices running iOS 17.2” but later qualifies that consistency is unconfirmed. This is contradictory.  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Clarify that initial reports indicate frequent crashes on iOS 17.2 but that consistency and scope require verification.\n",
       "\n",
       "- The mention of “beta and stable builds” of iOS 17.2 is good but could be expanded to clarify whether the problem appeared first in beta or only after stable release.  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Recommend timeline analysis to correlate crash reports with iOS 17.2 beta and stable rollout dates.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Style and Tone\n",
       "\n",
       "- The draft is formal and technical, appropriate for internal teams, but might be too detailed for some stakeholders.  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Tailor sections or provide summaries for different audiences (e.g., technical teams vs. product management).\n",
       "\n",
       "- Some sentences are long and complex, which may reduce readability.  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Break complex sentences into shorter, clearer statements. For example, “The timing of both the rating drop and upload crashes appears to align with the release or wider adoption of iOS 17.2” could be split into two sentences for emphasis.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Missing Information or Perspectives\n",
       "\n",
       "- No mention of whether the app has automated tests covering upload functionality and if these tests have been run against iOS 17.2 environments.  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Add a step to review and run automated tests on iOS 17.2 to detect regressions early.\n",
       "\n",
       "- The draft does not consider potential third-party SDKs or plugins that might be incompatible with iOS 17.2, beyond “networking libraries and file handling modules.”  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Broaden the audit scope to include all third-party dependencies, especially those related to UI, permissions, and background processing.\n",
       "\n",
       "- No explicit mention of rollback or hotfix strategies if a critical regression is confirmed.  \n",
       "  Suggestion: Include contingency planning for rapid mitigation, such as rolling back recent app updates or releasing hotfixes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall Assessment\n",
       "\n",
       "The draft provides a thorough and well-organized overview of the problem, diagnostic needs, and next steps. It successfully separates observed facts from hypotheses and emphasizes cross-team coordination. However, it would benefit from clearer prioritization, reduced redundancy, and more explicit emphasis on urgent data collection and impact quantification. Adding an executive summary and tailoring communication for different audiences would improve usability. Addressing the noted inconsistencies and expanding on missing aspects like automated testing and contingency planning will strengthen the response’s completeness and practical value.\n",
       "\n",
       "Suggested Revision Approach\n",
       "\n",
       "- Begin with a brief executive summary highlighting the core issues and immediate priorities.  \n",
       "- Consolidate diagnostic and testing steps into a streamlined action plan with clear priorities.  \n",
       "- Clarify ambiguous or contradictory statements about crash consistency and timing.  \n",
       "- Expand impact assessment with concrete metrics and user segmentation.  \n",
       "- Include security/privacy review and broader third-party dependency audit.  \n",
       "- Add recommendations for automated testing and contingency planning.  \n",
       "- Refine communication strategy to include user trust management and internal knowledge sharing.  \n",

       "\n",
       "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "### Critique of the Draft Response\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Clarity and Style Issues\n",
       "1. **Overly Complex Sentences**: Some sentences are lengthy and contain multiple clauses, which may confuse readers. For example, \"This deterioration in user experience has led to a rise in negative reviews\" could be simplified for clarity.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion**: Break down complex sentences into shorter, more digestible ones. For instance, \"The user experience has deteriorated. As a result, there has been a rise in negative reviews.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Lack of Clear Subheadings**: The draft combines various themes under broad headings without clearly delineating subtopics within those sections, making it harder for readers to follow the argument.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion**: Introduce subheadings within sections, especially under \"Key Observations\" and \"Areas for Further Exploration,\" to better categorize and clarify the information presented.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Completeness and Accuracy Issues\n",
       "3. **Missing Data on Competitive Analysis**: While the draft mentions the need for competitive analysis, it does not specify which competitors should be analyzed. Mentioning them explicitly could enhance context and provide a clearer direction.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion**: Include specific competitors (e.g., “Investigate how Competitor A and Competitor B have addressed similar upload issues”) to add clarity.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Insufficient Detail on User Journey Mapping**: The draft suggests mapping the user journey but fails to describe how this will be executed or what specific aspects will be focused on.\n",

       "\n",
       "5. **Lack of Metrics for Success**: The draft outlines next steps but does not define metrics to measure the success of the proposed actions.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion**: Specify success metrics for each next step, such as \"Aim for a 20% reduction in uninstall rates within three months post-update.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Structural Improvements\n",
       "6. **Repetition of Information**: Some points are repeated across sections, such as the decline in user engagement and app ratings. This redundancy can dilute the impact of the message.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion**: Consolidate similar information into a single statement to avoid redundancy. For example, combine observations about engagement metrics into one cohesive point under \"User Experience and Engagement.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Flow of Information**: The draft jumps between marketing and engineering challenges without a clear transition, which can disorient the reader.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion**: Use transitional phrases to guide the reader from one section to another. For example, \"From a technical perspective, the engineering team has identified specific issues that align with marketing's concerns about user dissatisfaction.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Factual Errors or Inconsistencies\n",
       "8. **Inconsistent Presentation of Metrics**: The draft states that uninstall rates have surged by 20% without providing a timeframe for this change. This lack of context makes it difficult to assess the urgency.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion**: Specify the timeframe for the 20% increase in uninstall rates (e.g., \"Uninstall rates have surged by 20% since the iOS 17.2 update\").\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Vagueness in Communication Strategy**: The communication strategy lacks specifics regarding the type of updates that will be provided to users.\n",
       "   - **Suggestion**: Detail the communication channels and frequency of updates, such as “Weekly email updates” or “Daily social media posts during critical fix phases.”\n",
       "\n",
       "### Overall Assessment\n",
