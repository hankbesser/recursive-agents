    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates multi-agent workflows using **pure Recursive Companion** without any external orchestration frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplicity**: No orchestration framework needed - just Python function calls\n",
    "2. **Full Transparency**: Every agent's thinking process is immediately accessible\n",
    "3. **Sequential Execution**: Clear, debuggable flow from Marketing ‚Üí Engineering ‚Üí Strategy\n",
    "4. **Zero Integration Overhead**: Companions work directly as callables\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll See:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How domain-specific agents analyze the same problem from different perspectives\n",
    "- The verbose mode showing real-time critique/revision cycles\n",
    "- Complete introspection into each agent's reasoning\n",
    "- How the Strategy companion synthesizes multiple viewpoints"
