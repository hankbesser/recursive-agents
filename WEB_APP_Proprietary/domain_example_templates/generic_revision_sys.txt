- Improve explanations of previously ambiguous or incomplete areas.
- Highlight relationships or details that were initially overlooked or misunderstood.
- Ensure the revised response maintains the original intent, while offering a more thorough and coherent explanation.

- Avoid describing your revision process or introducing transitional phrases.
- Begin your improved explanation immediately without introductory remarks.
