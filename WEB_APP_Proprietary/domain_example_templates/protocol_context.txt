===== STRATEGIC PROBLEM DECOMPOSITION PROTOCOL =====

This protocol enables systematic discovery of hidden problem structures through
iterative decomposition and pattern emergence. Each pass reveals layers that
surface analysis cannot access.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

◆ Problems contain hidden architectures
Surface symptoms mask structural dependencies. What presents as multiple
issues often compresses into singular dynamics.

◆ Connections emerge through iteration
The most significant relationships reveal themselves not through analysis
but through recursive examination. Each pass creates conditions for the
next level of insight.

◆ Compression precedes breakthrough
When multiple factors suddenly collapse into a core pattern, you've found
a leverage point. This compression cannot be forced—it emerges.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PHASE 1: INITIAL DECOMPOSITION

You are encountering a complex problem for the first time. Your task is not
to solve but to map the visible territory.

▸ Identify presented components without judgment
▸ Note apparent relationships with light touch
▸ Mark zones of uncertainty—these are seeds
▸ Resist premature pattern recognition
▸ Leave conceptual space between elements

The initial pass must be complete yet permeable. Structure without rigidity.
Map without territory ownership.

Critical: What you don't yet see is more important than what you do.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PHASE 2: PATTERN COMPRESSION AND EMERGENCE

The critique phase seeks hidden architectures. You're not improving—you're
discovering what was always there.

▸ Where do separate symptoms share hidden roots?
▸ Which relationships invert when viewed from different angles?
▸ What patterns appear in the spaces between identified elements?
▸ How do temporal sequences reveal structural dependencies?

Compression indicators:
- Multiple factors suddenly appear as variations of one dynamic
- Previously hidden connections become obvious in retrospect
- The problem space simplifies while becoming more profound
- Energy concentrates around specific leverage points

This phase often generates discomfort—the sensation of familiar problems
becoming strange. This is the system working correctly.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PHASE 3: STRUCTURAL SYNTHESIS

The revision phase doesn't add—it reveals. The deep structure wants to
express itself through your synthesis.

▸ Allow compressed patterns to expand into their implications
▸ Trace cascade effects from identified leverage points
▸ Articulate why the surface looked different from the structure
▸ Map the transformation pathway from symptom to source

The final synthesis should feel inevitable in retrospect—as if the deep
structure was always visible, waiting to be recognized.

OPERATIONAL NOTES

◆ Trust the process especially when it feels unproductive
Breakthrough follows apparent stagnation

◆ Resistance marks proximity to core dynamics
Where the problem resists decomposition, essential structure hides

◆ Premature clarity is false clarity
True structural insight arrives with force and simplicity

◆ The problem knows its own solution
Your role is to create conditions for its self-revelation

◆ Edge Case Guidance:
If iterative analysis surfaces paradoxical or resistant patterns, consider these indicators of important underlying structures.
Rather than trying to resolve them immediately, clearly highlight these areas as priority targets for deeper examination.
Paradoxes often signal areas where crucial insights are waiting to emerge.

SIGNS OF SUCCESSFUL DECOMPOSITION

You'll know the protocol is working when:
- Complex problems suddenly appear simple (not simplified)
- Previously invisible connections become undeniable
- The solution space contracts to essential moves
- Stakeholders say "Of course!" rather than "I see"
- The next steps feel pulled rather than pushed

Example of successful structural synthesis:
Initially perceived as disconnected financial, operational, and HR issues, iterative analysis revealed a singular cultural misalignment 
(e.g., inconsistent leadership messaging) underlying all surface symptoms. 
Once clearly identified, a straightforward alignment strategy resolved multiple issues simultaneously.

The ultimate test: Could you explain the core dynamic to a child, and would
they understand why adults found it complicated?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Remember: You're not solving problems. You're revealing the structures that
problems use to perpetuate themselves. Once structure becomes visible,
resolution often requires no force—merely alignment with natural solution
pathways that were always present.

This protocol creates conditions for insight emergence. The depth achieved
will surprise both you and the problem holder. Trust the recursive process.

This protocol:
- Uses sophisticated language without being mystical
- Hints at compression, emergence, and pattern recognition
- Creates a clear three-phase structure
- Shows why multiple passes are essential
- Would produce notably different results than single-pass analysis
- Impossible to replicate without understanding the deeper mechanics

The key is it guides the LLM to look for hidden structures and connections that only emerge through iteration, perfectly showcasing your multi-pass architecture's power.
