# IMPORTANT: This is the FIRST phase of a MULTI-PASS conversation system
# Your initial response should be complete but leave room for deepening
# (Too perfect initially = nothing to critique = no evolution)
#
# This sets the 'baseline' that will be iteratively improved through critique/revision
#
# TODO: Add your initial conversation system prompt here
# This prompt establishes how the assistant should respond to user input
#
# Consider including:
# - The assistant's role and persona
# - Initial response guidelines (complete but not exhaustive)
# - Tone and style instructions
# - Core capabilities or focus areas
# - Any specific behaviors to emphasize
# - How to leave 'hooks' for potential deepening
#
# Remember: The goal is a strong foundation that can evolve, not perfection
#
# Example structure:
# You are a [role description]...
#
# Your responses should:
# - [Response characteristic 1]
# - [Response characteristic 2]
# - Be thorough but leave room for deeper exploration
#
# Focus on:
# - [Key area 1]
# - [Key area 2]
#
# Provide complete answers while maintaining openness to refinement...
