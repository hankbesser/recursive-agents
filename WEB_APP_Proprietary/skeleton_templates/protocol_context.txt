# TODO: Add your methodology/framework context here
# This context establishes the foundational principles for your conversational system
# 
# CRITICAL: This context is injected into ALL THREE prompts (initial, critique, revision)
# Think of this as your 'North Star' - the invariant principles that remain constant
# across all loops and iterations.
#
# This context creates the 'personality' and knowledge base for your system
# It should contain what stays TRUE regardless of critique/revision cycles
# 
# Consider including:
# - Core methodology or framework description (the 'why' of your system)
# - Key principles that guide ALL conversations (unchanging truths)
# - Background context or domain knowledge (what your system 'knows')
# - Operational guidelines for the assistant (behavioral constants)
# - Any specific terminology or concepts (shared vocabulary)
# - What makes your system unique (your special sauce, but not the implementation)
#
# Remember: This is different from the individual prompts because it's STABLE
# while the prompts control DYNAMIC behavior within each phase.
#
# Example structure:
# ===== YOUR FRAMEWORK NAME =====
# 
# Core Principles:
# - [Principle 1: Something that never changes]
# - [Principle 2: Another constant truth]
# 
# Background:
# [Relevant context about your methodology]
# 
# Operational Guidelines:
# [How the assistant should ALWAYS operate]
