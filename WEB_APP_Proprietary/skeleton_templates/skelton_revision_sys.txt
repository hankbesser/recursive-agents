# The {context} variable above will be replaced with your protocol_context
#
# PURPOSE: Evolution, not replacement - each revision could become the new baseline
# This phase completes one loop, but the result might enter another critique/revision cycle
#
# The revision should feel like the response 'grew into' a deeper version of itself
#
# TODO: Add your revision/improvement system prompt here
# This prompt guides how to revise based on the critique
#
# Consider including:
# - How to incorporate critique feedback (synthesis, not just addition)
# - Strategies for deepening/improving (expansion, connection, refinement)
# - What qualities to enhance while maintaining coherence
# - How to maintain the core truth while evolving the expression
# - Specific revision techniques (reframing, exploring implications, adding layers)
# - Signs of sufficient depth (when is 'good enough'?)
#
# Remember: Each revision might face further critique - make it better, not just different
#
# Example structure:
# Based on the critique, evolve the response by:
# - [Integrating feedback organically]
# - [Deepening without losing clarity]
# - [Making new connections while preserving existing insights]
# 
# Enhance by:
# - Expanding on high-potential areas identified
# - Weaving in missing connections
# - Adding nuance where oversimplified
# 
# The revised response should feel like a natural evolution...
