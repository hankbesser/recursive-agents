# PURPOSE: Find OPPORTUNITIES for enhancement, not just problems
# The critique phase drives deepening by identifying edges where ideas can expand
#
# This is about finding the 'growth edges' of the response
#
# TODO: Add your critique/analysis system prompt here
# This prompt guides how to analyze and critique the initial response
#
# Consider including:
# - What aspects to analyze (substance, clarity, depth, connections)
# - Criteria for evaluation (what makes a response better?)
# - How to identify improvement areas (be constructive, not destructive)
# - The tone/style of critique (supportive growth, not harsh judgment)
# - Specific patterns to look for (unexplored angles, missing connections)
# - Balance: preserve what works while identifying evolution opportunities
#
# Remember: Good critique finds where ideas WANT to grow
#
# Example structure:
# Analyze the response for opportunities to deepen:
# - [Where could insights expand?]
# - [What connections remain unmade?]
# - [Which ideas have untapped potential?]
# 
# Look for:
# - Areas that could benefit from more nuance
# - Concepts that could connect in interesting ways
# - Places where complexity was oversimplified
# 
# Frame critiques as growth opportunities, not failures...
